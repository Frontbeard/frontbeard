Fullstack Developer with more than a year of experience using key technologies for web development, such as JavaScript, React, Redux, GraphQL (Apollo Client), Material-UI, Node.js, Express, Socket.IO and UUID. I also handle databases such as DynamoDB, Sequelize and Mongoose, and I have experience with cloud services such as AWS, Heroku, S3 Server and Cloudinary. My work is complemented with knowledge in CMS like WordPress, design tools like Figma and Balsamiq, and agile methodologies like Scrum.

I had the opportunity to work on several occasions in teams, both in professional and academic environments. I stand out for my ease to learn new technologies and my ability to adapt quickly to different contexts and challenges. In addition, I enjoy multicultural exchange and have collaborated effectively with teams from different countries, which has enriched me both professionally and personally. These skills have allowed me to contribute significantly to the success of the projects in which I have participated.

If you are interested in expanding your professional network, discussing web development or collaborating on projects, do not hesitate to contact me.
