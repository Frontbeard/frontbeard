Fullstack developer with one year of experience using key technologies for web development, including JavaScript, ReactJS, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, GraphQL (Apollo Client), and Socket.io. I also manage databases such as SQL, Sequelize, and DynamoDB, and have experience with cloud services such as AWS, S3 Server, and Cloudinary. My work is complemented with knowledge in CMS like WordPress, design tools like Figma and Balsamiq, and agile methodologies like Scrum.

I had the opportunity to work on several occasions in teams, both in professional and academic environments. I stand out for my ease to learn new technologies and my ability to adapt quickly to different contexts and challenges. These skills have allowed me to collaborate effectively with my colleagues and contribute significantly to the success of the projects in which I have participated.

If you are interested in expanding your professional network, discussing web development or collaborating on projects, don't hesitate to contact me.
